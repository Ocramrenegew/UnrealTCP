# UnrealTCP Documentation
UnrealTCP is a framework for creating an interface between [Unreal Engine](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/) and 
[Matlab](https://de.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html) with the goal of allowing easy data collection during listening experiments conducted in VR.
Data transmission is provided via a TCP connection with Matlab acting as a server. The framework consists of:
- A plugin created for Unreal Engine
- A Matlab application allowing for control of VR experiments
